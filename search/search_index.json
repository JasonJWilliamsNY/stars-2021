Brittany Johnson Brittany is a Middle School Educator at the DNA Learning Center. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Biology from Fisk University, and a Master of Biological Medical Sciences from Mississippi College. Brittany\u2019s involvement with the DNALC began when she attended school trips and participated in a Summer DNA Program creating antibiotic resistant genes held at Central Islip High School. She was grateful for the teachers who made sure she and others had the opportunity and exposure to this style of learning. Later, while volunteering in the then Central Islip School District (CISD) Mulligan Science Center a DNALC Educator came to do a lab, eventually leading her to pursue an opportunity to start a career with the DNALC team. The DNA Learning Center sparked an interest she never forgot, and as an educator, it is her aspiration to encourage critical thinking, while creating an environment and an excitement for learning.

How do we calculate the molecular weight of a compound? How do we calculate molarity and why do we make use of moles? Why do we have stock solutions? How do we dilute a stock solution? Discussion outline Concentration One of the most basic laboratory reagents will involve some solute in some solvent. We have performed this procedure countless times, for example when we add some sugar to a cup of hot tea. To find the concentration, we need to know how much solvent (usually in grams) is dissolved in how much solvent (usually measured in liters). Dilution of stock solutions Commonly, we will create high-concentration solutions in the lab that can later be diluted. A high-concentration solution is called a 'stock' solution. Making a stock solution allows us to save space. For example, if we have a solution that has 100g of salt in 1L of water, we need a liter-sized bottle to store it. However, if we dissolve 100g of salt in 0.1L of water, we can store the same amount of solution in 1/10th the space. Question How does using a stock solution (vs. making a new solution every time it is needed) make science more reproducible? To dilute a solution from the original concentration to a new concentration we need to keep track of several things: The original concentration of the solution The desired final amount (volume) of the dilution we are making Desired final concentration of the dilution we are making The thing we need to figure out is what amount (volume) of the concentrated stock solution do we need to add to more solvent to make a more dilute solution. Again, keep in mind that this is an 'everyday' problem. Imagine you made some soup and accidentally added too much salt. You can't take the salt out, but you can add more water to make the final concentration of the salt less. The formula for calculating dilutions is: C 1 V 1 = C 2 V 2 Where: C 1 = The original/starting concentration of the stock solution V 1 = The (unknown) amount (volume) of the stock solution you will need to use C 2 = The final, desired concentration V 2 = The final, desired volume you wish to make Moles Probably one of the most important concepts in chemistry is the concept of a mole). The mole is a special number (it even has its own holiday). A mole is just a number, but a very large one: 6.02214078\u00d710 23 (A mole: also known as, Avagadro's Number) A 'mole' is actually shorthand for that large number. Just like a 'dozen' = 12, a couple = 2, etc. So why do we need this number? Well, Atoms are very small. We can't count them one by one, but when we have lots of atoms (several grams at least for the kinds of scales we have at school), we can measure and estimate how many atoms we have. Weighing atoms By definition, when we have a mole of atoms, we have 6.02214078\u00d710 23 atoms. In reality, just like not every egg will weigh 73g, different atoms have a diffent atomic mass. On the periodic table, the atomic mass is the number below the element symbol: For carbon (C), 12.011g of carbon, we have 6.02214078\u00d710 23 carbon atoms. A 1.008g sample of hydrogen (H) weighs much less but has the same number of atoms. Why this is very important With an understanding of Avagradro's number and the atomic masses from the periodic table, we can accomplish something amazing. When we combine elements to form a new compound (e.g. combining hydrogen and oxygen to make water), we know exactly how much (mass) of hydrogen we need to combine with how much oxygen so that we have enough amounts of each. Molar mass/moluar mass/fomula weight When we have a compound such as Glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) we calculate the molar mass as the sum of the total number of moles of each atom in the compound. C 6 H 12 O 6 6 Moles of Carbon 12 Moles of Hydrogen 6 Moles of Oxygen Molarity Related to moles is the concept of molarity, or how many moles of a substance do we have in a solution. The formula for molarity of is: Moles of solute/ Liters of solvent Limiting reagents Conceptually, knowing how many moles we have allows us to determine in advance how many moles of a substance is needed to create a particular molecule. For example: C 6 H 12 O 6 Would require us to have 6 moles of Carbon, 6 moles of Oxygen, and 12 moles of Hydrogen While we won't solve an example here, the sandwich example below gets the point across about limiting reagents - we can only make a much of a substance as the least abundant component will allow; If we have hundreds of slices of cheese, but only 2 slices of bread, we get only one sandwich.

We have performed this procedure countless times, for example when we add some sugar to a cup of hot tea. To find the concentration, we need to know how much solvent (usually in grams) is dissolved in how much solvent (usually measured in liters).","title":"Concentration"},{"location":"_includes/laboratories/lab_math/#dilution-of-stock-solutions","text":"Commonly, we will create high-concentration solutions in the lab that can later be diluted. A high-concentration solution is called a 'stock' solution. Making a stock solution allows us to save space. For example, if we have a solution that has 100g of salt in 1L of water, we need a liter-sized bottle to store it. However, if we dissolve 100g of salt in 0.1L of water, we can store the same amount of solution in 1/10th the space. Question How does using a stock solution (vs. making a new solution every time it is needed) make science more reproducible? To dilute a solution from the original concentration to a new concentration we need to keep track of several things: The original concentration of the solution The desired final amount (volume) of the dilution we are making Desired final concentration of the dilution we are making The thing we need to figure out is what amount (volume) of the concentrated stock solution do we need to add to more solvent to make a more dilute solution. Again, keep in mind that this is an 'everyday' problem. Imagine you made some soup and accidentally added too much salt. You can't take the salt out, but you can add more water to make the final concentration of the salt less. The formula for calculating dilutions is: C 1 V 1 = C 2 V 2 Where: C 1 = The original/starting concentration of the stock solution V 1 = The (unknown) amount (volume) of the stock solution you will need to use C 2 = The final, desired concentration V 2 = The final, desired volume you wish to make","title":"Dilution of stock solutions"},{"location":"_includes/laboratories/lab_math/#moles","text":"Probably one of the most important concepts in chemistry is the concept of a mole).

You should copy protocols into you notebook, leaving ample room for your own notes. Unless otherwise noted, protocols are from/adapted from the DNA Learning Center . Questions your lab notes should answer For major steps, include your notes on what is happening; what is the purpose of this step? Include your observations; is there a color change? can I sketch or include a photo of what is happening? Don't just say what you did, say what you saw. Document anomalies. Did the instructor say I should expect to see something I am not seeing? Did I make a mistake and add too much/little of a reagent? Include details so if something goes wrong, you can work out why that might be. Be objective; when I make descriptions am I giving estimates using objective measurable terms? For example: \"I see a ~ 3 mm pellet\", \"I collected a sample of approximately 10 grams\". Even if you don't have a scale or ruler you can give your best detailed estimates. Include your results in your notes! How lab notebooks should be kept Lab notebooks aren't just a high school exercise. In every laboratory, there are lab notebooks and they are the most important record of your work. Note : A notebook is not your own. In a laboratory the notebook belongs to the PI (primary investigator), the person who runs the laboratory. A lab notebook is the authoritative record of how experiments were performed, and the data they generated. Here are some points to remember for our lab notebooks. Notebook entries should be neatly written in pen ( not pencil ). If needed, the notebook may also be typed. If an error is made, it should be neatly crossed out. The point is that there should be a permanent record that is unalterable. In cases of scientific fraud notebooks may be checked . Every page of the notebook (or every new entry) should have a date. We will also have a title for the various entries in our lab notebooks. There are usually two types of entries: Lab demos: Are demonstrations of techniques. You will take notes but not not necessarily do the experiment yourself. Labs: These are full labs where you and lab partners will preform the experiment. In many cases you will be provided a protocol for the lab. You should still copy the protocol into your notebook with annotations as to what you observed and notes if the protocol is modified in any way. Photos, sketches, and any other records or results should be entered in your notebook.

In every laboratory, there are lab notebooks and they are the most important record of your work. Note : A notebook is not your own. In a laboratory the notebook belongs to the PI (primary investigator), the person who runs the laboratory. A lab notebook is the authoritative record of how experiments were performed, and the data they generated. Here are some points to remember for our lab notebooks. Notebook entries should be neatly written in pen ( not pencil ). If needed, the notebook may also be typed. If an error is made, it should be neatly crossed out. The point is that there should be a permanent record that is unalterable. In cases of scientific fraud notebooks may be checked . Every page of the notebook (or every new entry) should have a date. We will also have a title for the various entries in our lab notebooks. There are usually two types of entries: Lab demos: Are demonstrations of techniques. You will take notes but not not necessarily do the experiment yourself. Labs: These are full labs where you and lab partners will preform the experiment. In many cases you will be provided a protocol for the lab. You should still copy the protocol into your notebook with annotations as to what you observed and notes if the protocol is modified in any way. Photos, sketches, and any other records or results should be entered in your notebook.","title":"How lab notebooks should be kept"},{"location":"_includes/laboratories/protocols_intro/#links-and-reading","text":"How to Start\u2013and Keep\u2013a Laboratory Notebook: Policy and Practical Guidelines","title":"Links and reading"},{"location":"_includes/laboratories/rapid_plant_barcoding/","text":"Plant DNA Barcoding (Rapid DNA Isolation) Protocol Note: See expanded protocols at dnabarcoding101.org Materials Lysis solution (6 M Guanidine Hydrochloride GuHCl) (120 \u00b5L) Wash buffer (480 \u00b5L) TE buffer (75 \u00b5L) Specimen tissue sample(s) (from Part I) Whatman No.1 Chromatography paper discs (2, 3-mm diameter) Microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 mL) Micropipettes and tips (2\u20131000 \u00b5L) Permanent marker Sterile plastic pestles Microcentrifuge tube rack Sterile tweezers Steps Obtain plant, fungal, or animal tissue ~10 mg or \u215b- to \u00bc-inch diameter by removing a piece of the tissue with a razor blade, clean tweezers, scissors, or back of a 10-\u00b5L pipette tip to enable efficient lysis. If you are working with more than one sample, be careful not to cross-contaminate specimens. (If you only have one specimen, make a balance tube with the appropriate volume of water for centrifugation steps.) Be sure to preserve the remainder of the organism at -20\u00b0C or in 96\u2013100% Ethanol. Tip: Tissue should be no larger than a grain of rice. Using more than the recommended amount can affect amplification. Place tissue in a clean 1.5-mL tube labeled with a sample identification number. Add 50 \u00b5L of lysis solution to each tube. Tip: Lysis solution dissolves membrane-bound organelles including the nucleus, mitochondria, and chloroplast.. Twist a clean plastic pestle against the inner surface of 1.5-mL tube to forcefully grind the tissue for at least 2 minutes. Use a clean pestle for each sample. Ensure the sample is ground into fine particles. Tip: Grinding breaks up cell walls and other tough material. Once ground, the sample should be liquid, but there may be some particulate matter remaining. For each sample, use a separate sterile tweezer to add one 3-mm diameter disc of Whatman No. 1 Chromatography paper to the lysed extract. Tap or flick the tube gently to ensure the disc is fully submerged in the extract. Allow the disc to soak in the extract for 1 minute. Tip: Whatman chromatography paper binds the DNA, helping separate DNA from contaminants. While the disc is soaking, add 200 \u00b5L of wash buffer to a clean 1.5-mL tube labeled with the sample identification number. Tip: Wash buffer will remove contaminants that can inhibit PCR while the DNA remains bound to the paper. Remove the disc from the extract using a sterile tweezer or pipette tip and transfer the disc into the fresh tube containing wash buffer. Tap or flick the tube to mix for 5 seconds, then allow the disc to sit in the wash buffer for 1 minute. Tip: Discard/set-aside the tweezer following Step 7. Use of the tweezer to transfer the disc in future steps will contaminate the disc with impurities that may affect PCR. Use a sterile pipette tip to gently drag the disc out of the wash buffer and up the tube wall to dry at the top of the tube. Ensure that little to no debris is attached to the disk. Allow the disc to air dry for 2 minutes to evaporate the ethanol on the disc. Tip: Ethanol in the wash buffer can inhibit PCR, so drying the paper after the wash step is required. While the disc is air-drying, add 30 \u00b5L of TE to a clean 1.5-mL tube labeled with the sample identification number. Once dry, carefully transfer the disc using a sterile tweezer or pipette tip into the fresh tube containing 30 \u00b5L of TE. Allow the disc to soak for a minimum of 15 minutes at ambient temperature (soaking the disc overnight at 4\u00b0 C is optimal) to elute the purified DNA. The disc in TE can be stored at 4\u00b0 C temporarily or frozen at -20\u00b0 C for long-term storage until ready to begin Part III; ensure that the disc has incubated at ambient temperature for at least 15 minutes before storage at 4\u00b0 C or -20\u00b0 C. In Part III, you will use 2 \u03bcL of DNA for each PCR reaction. This is a crude DNA extract and contains nucleases that will eventually fragment the DNA at room temperature.

Here are some questions to answer before reading further What is a \"method\"? What are some examples you can think of? What makes something \"scientific\"? What is the scientific method? Concept 01 - Methods are an approach to predictable results This may not sound particularly insightful, but starting from this general concept, we will explore it for now in a very specific context. Let's start with a tentative definition for the scientific method: The Scientific Method is the idea that questions about the natural world can by answered by following some set of steps to acquire knowledge and explain that knowledge in the form of a hypothesis . Philosophy and inquiry When we ask \"what something is?\" we are immediately in the realm of philosophy. Philosophy is a deep and wonderful area of human knowledge. It is not science, but for centuries it has explored important questions scientists would do well not to ignore Philosophy does Concept Clarification : One of the tasks of philosophy is to clarify what we mean when we say something. Take the phrase \"it's a beautiful day.\" What is beauty? What is the day? Philosophy is nearly endless in its pursuit of questions, and questions of the form \"what is X?\" lead to entire fields of philosophical study (e.g. \"what is beauty\" is the subject of aesthetics; \"what is a part and what is a whole?\" is the subject of mereology). Philosophy tries to help us be clear about words and their meaning, and what we mean when we use those words. To get quickly to the practical, how do we benefit from the work philosophy does? Here are four questions philosophy has worked on and that we can learn from: Philosophy asks What is knowledge? Epistemology - \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 * is a branch of philosophy that asks the question how can we know something? What is evidence for/against something? How and when should we trust (or refuse to trust) evidence? When do we have enough evidence? These are very important questions in the sciences. What is logical? Logic - \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae is a branch of philosophy which asks about what are the rules of reason and reasoning. Given some premise (e.g. Socrates is a man, men are mortal) how do we reach a conclusion (e.g. Socrates is a man, therefore he is mortal) that is true? Logic also gives rise to mathematics which underlies the natural sciences (although math is not a science). How do we communicate our meaning? Philosophy of language asks how do we use words (or signs; see semantics \u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ) to represent abstract concepts? In the English language for example, I can \" know that I have 3 dollars in my pocket\" and I can \" know how my friend thinks.\" Spanish, like other Romance languages distinguishes between knowing a fact (verb: saber) from knowing someone you have relationship with (verb: conocer). Ultimately, to operate in science we need to weigh evidence, develop logical conclusions, and express our meaning. These approaches are not inherently scientific, but they are used by science. Philosophy of science is concerned with a more thorough exploration of what the role of philosophy is in the sciences. Take home message : Science makes use of philosophical tools (methods) to do its work. At some point, you should get to know a bit about that subject. * Note : Although here and in many cases philosophy makes use of Greek terms this is not meant to privilege Greek or Western thought. Every human culture has its own ways of thinking and reasoning and it is arrogant to suggest that the most popular (or best documented) approach is necessarily the best one. It is also arrogant to imagine that Greek philosophy did not have its antecedents in other cultures. The use of the Greek terms above is to draw attention both to the important contributions of the Greek scholars and to acknowledge that if we ignore their specific origin we risk imagining that these are the only possible ways to think about these terms. Key questions After that detour through philosophy, how do we bring those ideas back to science? Well, to do science we need to have a working definition so let's return to the one suggested above: The Scientific Method is the idea that questions about the natural world can by answered by following some set of steps to acquire knowledge about the world and explain that knowledge in the form of a hypothesis . Using this definition, and the one you posed in the What do you know questions, here are some additional ones to ask. Does the scientific method resemble how we ask questions about the world in in ways that aren't traditionally considered science? For example, is a criminal investigation scientific? Is the exploration of a theme in the Beethoven's Diabelli variations (Op. 120) scientific? Is a model volcano presented at a science fair scientific? What is the \"natural world\"? Besides the scientific method, what other methods do you think we might see used in science? Activity Short essay About short essay assignments Short essay assignments are typed, 500 words maximum or less. In addition to getting to know your thoughts they are also a chance to get feedback on your writing. You will usually have a minimum of two weeks to complete these assignments. It is highly suggested that you give yourself time to write a first draft, reflect and/or get feedback, and write a final draft. Write a short essay on the following topic: The scientific method is a unique form of inquiry The point of your essay can be to support or refute the above statement; it's your choice which position to support. Think about breaking up this essay into 3 sections Introduction to the scientific method A body where you contrast the scientific method with one or more other forms of inquiry (for example, how does the scientific method compare to how a fiction author explores a character in a novel). A conclusion where you summarize your thoughts This is something more of an English assignment rather than a scientific writing assignment. You may have any opinion or position you want, but develop your ideas clearly and keep your writing simple.

Books What Is This Thing Called Science? - Alan F. Chalmers Amazon link Amazon Summary: Since its first publication in 1976, Alan Chalmers's highly regarded and widely read work--translated into eighteen languages--has become a classic introduction to the scientific method, known for its accessibility to beginners and its value as a resource for advanced students and scholars. Defending Science - within reason - Susan Haack Amazon link Amazon Summary: Sweeping in scope, penetrating in analysis, and generously illustrated with examples from the history of science, this new and original approach to familiar questions about scientific evidence and method tackles vital questions about science and its place in society. Avoiding the twin pitfalls of scientism and cynicism, noted philosopher Susan Haack argues that, fallible and flawed as they are, the natural sciences have been among the most successful of human enterprises-valuable not only for the vast, interlocking body of knowledge they have discovered, and not only for the technological advances that have improved our lives, but as a manifestation of the human talent for inquiry at its imperfect but sometimes remarkable best. This wide-ranging, trenchant, and illuminating book explores the complexities of scientific evidence, and the multifarious ways in which the sciences have refined and amplified the methods of everyday empirical inquiry; articulates the ways in which the social sciences are like the natural sciences, and the ways in which they are different; disentangles the confusions of radical rhetoricians and cynical sociologists of science; exposes the evasions of apologists for religious resistance to scientific advances; weighs the benefits and the dangers of technology; tracks the efforts of the legal system to make the best use of scientific testimony; and tackles predictions of the eventual culmination, or annihilation, of the scientific enterprise.Writing with verve and wry humor, in a witty, direct, and accessible style, Haack takes readers beyond the \"Science Wars\" to a balanced understanding of the value, and the limitations, of the scientific enterprise.","title":"Introduction to scientific method"},{"location":"science_topics/science_method/#scientific-method","text":"","title":"Scientific Method"},{"location":"science_topics/science_method/#what-do-you-know","text":"Here are some questions to answer before reading further What is a \"method\"?

Epistemology - \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 * is a branch of philosophy that asks the question how can we know something? What is evidence for/against something? How and when should we trust (or refuse to trust) evidence? When do we have enough evidence? These are very important questions in the sciences. What is logical? Logic - \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae is a branch of philosophy which asks about what are the rules of reason and reasoning. Given some premise (e.g. Socrates is a man, men are mortal) how do we reach a conclusion (e.g. Socrates is a man, therefore he is mortal) that is true? Logic also gives rise to mathematics which underlies the natural sciences (although math is not a science). How do we communicate our meaning? Philosophy of language asks how do we use words (or signs; see semantics \u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ) to represent abstract concepts? In the English language for example, I can \" know that I have 3 dollars in my pocket\" and I can \" know how my friend thinks.\" Spanish, like other Romance languages distinguishes between knowing a fact (verb: saber) from knowing someone you have relationship with (verb: conocer). Ultimately, to operate in science we need to weigh evidence, develop logical conclusions, and express our meaning. These approaches are not inherently scientific, but they are used by science. Philosophy of science is concerned with a more thorough exploration of what the role of philosophy is in the sciences. Take home message : Science makes use of philosophical tools (methods) to do its work. At some point, you should get to know a bit about that subject. * Note : Although here and in many cases philosophy makes use of Greek terms this is not meant to privilege Greek or Western thought. Every human culture has its own ways of thinking and reasoning and it is arrogant to suggest that the most popular (or best documented) approach is necessarily the best one. It is also arrogant to imagine that Greek philosophy did not have its antecedents in other cultures. The use of the Greek terms above is to draw attention both to the important contributions of the Greek scholars and to acknowledge that if we ignore their specific origin we risk imagining that these are the only possible ways to think about these terms.","title":"Philosophy asks"},{"location":"science_topics/science_method/#key-questions","text":"After that detour through philosophy, how do we bring those ideas back to science? Well, to do science we need to have a working definition so let's return to the one suggested above: The Scientific Method is the idea that questions about the natural world can by answered by following some set of steps to acquire knowledge about the world and explain that knowledge in the form of a hypothesis . Using this definition, and the one you posed in the What do you know questions, here are some additional ones to ask. Does the scientific method resemble how we ask questions about the world in in ways that aren't traditionally considered science? For example, is a criminal investigation scientific? Is the exploration of a theme in the Beethoven's Diabelli variations (Op. 120) scientific? Is a model volcano presented at a science fair scientific? What is the \"natural world\"? Besides the scientific method, what other methods do you think we might see used in science?","title":"Key questions"},{"location":"science_topics/science_method/#activity","text":"","title":"Activity"},{"location":"science_topics/science_method/#short-essay","text":"About short essay assignments Short essay assignments are typed, 500 words maximum or less.

Books What Is This Thing Called Science? - Alan F. Chalmers Amazon link Amazon Summary: Since its first publication in 1976, Alan Chalmers's highly regarded and widely read work--translated into eighteen languages--has become a classic introduction to the scientific method, known for its accessibility to beginners and its value as a resource for advanced students and scholars. Defending Science - within reason - Susan Haack Amazon link Amazon Summary: Sweeping in scope, penetrating in analysis, and generously illustrated with examples from the history of science, this new and original approach to familiar questions about scientific evidence and method tackles vital questions about science and its place in society. Avoiding the twin pitfalls of scientism and cynicism, noted philosopher Susan Haack argues that, fallible and flawed as they are, the natural sciences have been among the most successful of human enterprises-valuable not only for the vast, interlocking body of knowledge they have discovered, and not only for the technological advances that have improved our lives, but as a manifestation of the human talent for inquiry at its imperfect but sometimes remarkable best. This wide-ranging, trenchant, and illuminating book explores the complexities of scientific evidence, and the multifarious ways in which the sciences have refined and amplified the methods of everyday empirical inquiry; articulates the ways in which the social sciences are like the natural sciences, and the ways in which they are different; disentangles the confusions of radical rhetoricians and cynical sociologists of science; exposes the evasions of apologists for religious resistance to scientific advances; weighs the benefits and the dangers of technology; tracks the efforts of the legal system to make the best use of scientific testimony; and tackles predictions of the eventual culmination, or annihilation, of the scientific enterprise.Writing with verve and wry humor, in a witty, direct, and accessible style, Haack takes readers beyond the \"Science Wars\" to a balanced understanding of the value, and the limitations, of the scientific enterprise.","title":"Readings and resources"},{"location":"science_topics/writing_intro/","text":"Writing Corner Scientists are writers Writing is the one thing you will never see a scientist doing on film or TV. In reality, the more senior a scientist you are the less time you spend doing experiments and the more time you spend writing. Why is writing essential for scientists? Your entire career depends upon: Your ability to clearly communicate your research results Your ability to convince prospective employers your work is important Your ability to convince those who fund your work (sometimes your employer, but more often government agencies and philanthropic foundations) that they should pay for your work to be done There are other reasons to be a good writer, but if you fail in the three areas above, your career will end before it starts. You've been misled In your life as a student, you have almost certainly been misled about writing. This has not been done purposely but as a symptom of standard education. By high school you have already done a fair amount of writing. By college graduation you may have written more essays than you will ever do later in life (unless you become a writer, or a scientist). Where does deception fit in? For most of your life as a writer, people (your teachers) have been paid to read your writing. That circumstance is opposite to how the real world works - unless you become a novelist and are successful enough that people pay you to read your writing. Your beautiful lab reports, flowing essays, and personal stories are usually read by people whose job depends on reading your work (see the video link at the end on the craft of writing effectively to which I credit this insight). Even if your writing is poor, your teachers will still read it and hopefully give you useful feedback. Why does this make you a victim? When people are judging you by your writing, and when they have the option to stop reading your writing they are in a far different position than your teachers. If your writing is confusing, redundant, hard to follow, etc. your readers will simply stop reading Having your writing discarded is devastating if your reader is a college admission officer, an employer, or a science funding agency. It's also something to remember when you are given instructions for an assignment (e.g. a format, font, word limit you are asked to follow). If you violate those rules you can usually guarantee it will be counted against you (I can't tell you how many time students have asked if they can exceed a word limit - don't!). These instructions are usually given by people who need to review 10's - 100's of essays/applications/etc. and they are looking for ways to reduce their workload (not to mention maintain impartiality and fairness towards those who did follow the rules). Don't be ashamed or feel insecure if your writing skills are poor at the moment. Writing is a skill, and can be learned and improved by practice. Practicing this skill is worth it. Good writing enables a scientist to succeed. Even if you don't plan on being a scientist, this advice will benefit you. How to become a good writer The best advice: the more you write, read other's writing, and (importantly) edit writing, the more natural good writing will be for you. Good writing skills are a long-term self-improvement project that's never too late to begin. I'll admit up front that this article cannot make you into a good writer. While you still need to get to that destination, no single step will take you there. Instead, I have assembled a few resources to help. I have also taken a perspective, the one taken by the book The Longman Guide to Revising Prose - we will focus on good editing skills rather than writing. Why focus on editing? I'll answer in two quotes (I hope the sources correct, but the ideas are valid) \"All writing is rewriting\" - John Green, Author \"I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.\" Blaise Pascal, Philosopher/Mathematician You are smart, creative, and original. But like most human beings, it's more than likely that what you first write on the page is not the clearest expression of what you want to communicate. It is said that we often judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their actions. What that aphorism means in relation to writing is that we usually know what we mean to say when we write something down. What we have actually said is what our readers may interpret - which is usually full of differences we didn't expect. Although gap between author and reader sounds like a recipe for frustration, there are some easy ways to overcome most of the problems caused by this dilemma. The first and easiest solution is to put distance between yourself and your writing. Have you ever read something you wrote a few days or weeks ago and found things that were unclear or errors of some sort? By reading your writing after some time has past, you become a more objective reader, and can often find and fix mistakes. This is the best argument for making sure that you give yourself as much time as possible for writing assignments. Work out how much time (including days away from writing) needed to write a first, second, and perhaps even a third draft. Rushed, last-minute writing will almost certainly cost you. As you become a better writer you will also become a better editor of your own writing. The next thing suggestion for editing is to follow a method . The method suggested below will not correct every type of writing difficulty, but provides clear guidelines for revising writing. Paramedic Method Below are a handout and video that explains this method (which is detailed and elaborated on in the above mentioned Longman Guide book). I will not ask you memorize this method or demand that you always use it. I do hope that if you take a little time to understand it, you will apply in revision assignment below. This method has a few versions and I'll list a few steps at its core: Circle/highlight prepositions (of, in, to, etc.) - You will be looking to reduce or eliminate prepositions. Circle the \"is\" forms of verbs (where possible you will want to eliminate the verb to be) Circle the action (you will want to replace \"is/to be\" verbs with action verbs) Simplify actions and avoid compound verbs Start sentences fast - get to the point and avoid filler Read the writing aloud with feeling and correct sentences that sound awkward These 6 rules may sound a bit intimidating, but as I said you don't have to memorize them. Instead, watch this video that explains how this method works: The Paramedic Method [17 minutes] Paramedic method handout - this is unrelated to the specific video but has some nice examples This method is a first step to writing clear sentences. Besides clear sentence structure you must also think about how you develop logical arguments and how your voice makes it easy for the reader to understand your meaning. These edits go beyond sentence structure and we can cover them in a future assignment. The final step of improving writing is to actually have someone else read your writing. A good editor should return to you a document covered in red ink. Your obligation is put aside any pride and getting upset. Instead, you should be grateful for anyone who gives a critical assessment and strive to use suggestions to improve your result. Never take editing personally . Even the most skilled writers will always face the editor's pen. One more piece of advice Here are some rules by Orson Welles on writing well. They've stood the test of time: Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print. (i.e avoid cliche) Never use a long word where a short one will do. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out. Never use the passive where you can use the active. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent. (This rule will bend for science writing) Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous. Assignment You were asked to write a short essay about the scientific method.

After perhaps years of work a scientist (actually almost a group of scientists) will write a paper (often called a manuscript) detailing their work. Purpose of the paper \u2013 adding pieces to the puzzle The purpose of the paper is to communicate the new contribution the scientists\u2019 work represented. In very rare occasions, that contribution is something new and unexpected (i.e., an entirely new phenomenon). For example, see this article and the original paper on the discovery of that the universe was not static, but expanding. More often, scientists answer smaller questions or pieces of questions. Think about science more as discovering an image as you slowly add puzzle pieces, rather than discovering an image by turning a corner in a museum \u201cand there it is!\u201d What this means is that amongst a group of scientists (usually called a field or discipline, for example \u201ccancer biologists\u201d) there are a variety of related questions big and small. For example, if we asked a school to figure out how cars work (no Wikipedia or Google), we might investigate how engines work, how transmissions work, how gasoline works, how wheels work, etc. There is one big question (how cars work) but the way to answer that is usually by figuring out how individual components work and trying to put that knowledge together. This approach is called reductionism (reducing a large problem to the sum of its parts). It is not the only approach, and does not always work, but that is another conversation. When you write your paper, you are announcing you have found a new and important puzzle piece! But there are problems. Scientific questions usually come from a really big puzzle. Suppose in your section of the puzzle you have found a starfish. Maybe the puzzle is a beach scene? But what if someone else\u2019s puzzle pieces are shaping into a snowy mountain? They might not believe you are interpreting things correctly. You may think the same - maybe their section will turn out to be a cloud? You will not only need to put some context to your work (i.e., we have other pieces that look like sand and water), but you will need to prove you are qualified to tell what starfishes look like (i.e., you have a marine biology degree). You will need to show you are both working on the same puzzle and your pieces belong to the same image. Before we get too lost in analogy, let\u2019s come back to the main sections of a paper and see what they do for us. Paper Sections \u2013 demonstrating your puzzle piece fits and is important Typically, a paper will present the following sections. Here is what they are and do: Abstract This is usually a very short summary of the main findings of your work. We aren\u2019t writing a mystery novel where we want to build up to our new and important findings. Instead, we clearly state the main question we are working on and what we have found. The purpose here is to help the reader decide if the paper will be interesting to them (i.e., that it addresses a question they are working on, or is related to questions they work on). Example paper: \u201cIn this paper we describe the discovery of several puzzle pieces which suggest a starfish is located in grid A7 of puzzle 124.\u201d \u2013 A reader also working in or near that grid might want to know if they will find similar images, or if maybe combining their data with yours will make a clearer picture. Other readers working further away might wonder if this means the overall scene might turn out to be a beach. Readers working on puzzle 125 might not decide to read this paper. Introduction Usually, three things are accomplished in this section: Statement of importance : You will state something about the general importance of the scientific questions you are working on. For example, \u201cIf we could grow more wheat under drought conditions, famers in dry climates could double the world\u2019s food supply.\u201d Statement of what is already known : Here you will try to give some information about what the consensus of facts are on this topic. Usually, you will mention other important papers which people trust as the current most reliable facts on the topic. Your contribution : Here you will try to show how your findings relate to the existing facts. Almost always there will also be current hypotheses, things that scientists believe are true but which we still don\u2019t fully understand or have enough evidence for. Here you tell the reader what your paper adds. Perhaps you have found new evidence to support a hypothesis, or you have evidence that suggests the hypothesis is wrong. Example paper: \u201cPeople who like beach scenes are always in search of new photos because they are enjoyable and make great decorations for the living room. It generally accepted that beach photos reduce stress and lead to a happy home environment. Previously, it has been suggested (Smith, 1993) that puzzle 124 (P-124) may ultimately be a beach scene. This hypothesis is also supported by the findings of Nash (1998, 2002) that assembled a beach ball in grid A2 of the puzzle. Lubbock 2017 contested the beach scene hypothesis when they claimed a section of grid A7 suggested a basketball, an item rarely if ever found in beach scenes. We have previously reported several seashell images in grid A6 (Greenwald 2018). Using new method for Computer-Automated-discovery of Marine Life (CAML), a software described in Black 2019 we now report a potential starfish (Asteroidea) in grid A7. The updated version of this software (CAML -STAR) could accelerate the detection of other Starfish and finally confirm the P-124 beach scene hypothesis. Methods At some point, the paper will need to describe the work done to generate data. That data is then the basis for conclusions that are described later in the paper. Ideally the methods section will be detailed enough so that someone could replicate the work you have done. In some papers the methods themselves are not new. In that case this section could be as short as referring to another more detailed paper and describing that you followed that previously published method (perhaps you will describe any minor modifications). Other papers may have a longer methods section if they have created a new method. Example paper: A collection of 100 images which have been identified as coming from grid A7 were loaded into the CAML software (following the instructions detailed in Black 2019). However, we updated the original software to be more sensitive to the colors and textures more closely associated with known starfishes. Next, we used several known images to see if the CAML software could positively identify the known starfishes. After making adjustments to the software code, we developed an analysis of all 100 grid A7 images. For each image the software generated a score (1-100) that estimated the likelihood that the image segment was of starfish origin (with 100 being an almost certain match). A link to the copy of this new software (CAML -STAR) is included in the supplemental materials. Results In this section, you will present the data generated by your experiments. Here you will often have graphs and images (collectively known as \u201cfigures\u201d). These figures are often what your readers will care most about! This is because for readers that are familiar with your questions and the current research, the data are hopefully convincing enough that all of your other writing is just the \u201cicing on the cake.\u201d Here you will present your data with a minimal amount of interpretation. The figures themselves also need appropriate captions. These captions should explain what the figure shows and should have enough information that they stand on their own. There may also be statistical analyses in these sections. Using the mathematics of statistics there are a number of \u201cstatistical tests\u201d that we can run on data to help us determine if a result we obtain is likely to have happened by chance (accident) or if our data is very unlikely to have been observed purely by random chance. Example paper: In figure 1 we present image 62 of our puzzle piece collection along with an image of a known starfish. We show in figure 2 that CAML -STAR software is reliable because it was able to tell known-starfish images (positive control) from non-starfish images (negative control) with 99% accuracy. Figure 3 shows \u201cstarfish\u201d score for each of our 100 images. 98% of our images had a score of 95 or higher. This is a very unlikely result if our images did not come from starfish. The probability of these observations happening by random chance is less than 5% (p <0.05, Chi-Squared statistical test). Discussion In this section of the paper, your goal is to draw logical conclusions from the data presented to the questions and hypotheses you identified in the introduction. To do that, you need to think about what a reader who is familiar with the science might ask about the conclusions you pose. For example, if you are using a well-tested and reliable method, readers may not have many questions about the soundness of the method is (assuming you presented it in a detailed enough fashion). If your method is new, then much of your discussion and data need to support the method\u2019s reliability. If your conclusions fit neatly with existing hypotheses, your arguments may not need as much evidence than a case when your conclusions seek to overturn longstanding and accepted conclusions. Here you may also propose a new or modified hypothesis and suggest future work that can explore that new hypothesis. Remember, we don\u2019t irrefutably prove things in science, we present evidence that supports or rejects hypotheses and work to refine our hypotheses so that we can make more accurate predictions about phenomena and how they work. Example paper: In this study, we presented CAML-STAR a reliable new software that can identify starfishes with a low rate of error. [Many sentences explaining the figures and how the data support this conclusion]. When applied to images from grid A7 puzzle 124 we can conclude with a high degree of confidence that we have identified a starfish image in this grid. This work strongly supports the \u201cbeach scene\u201d hypothesis for puzzle 124. We anticipate future work may be able to make a species identification of the identified starfish and be used to identify other starfish in puzzle 124 and perhaps elsewhere. References Throughout your paper, much of the knowledge presented will be from the work of previous investigations. It is important that when you present work that has been generated by others that you credit that work. Typically, a paper we will list the name/names of the researchers who published those papers and the year the work was published. You don\u2019t have to provide a reference for every fact (e.g., \u201cwater is wet\u201d), but accepted conclusions in the field will be noted. In the references section, you will present the list of authors, the title of the paper, and the journal and journal issue the work appeared in. The order of those items can vary according to where you publish. There is no writing or explanation here just a numbered list. It is also possible that references in the main text are only noted by superscript numbers (e.g., \u201cwe know that beach scene have a calming effect on the human mood1.\u201d) Example paper: References 1. Smith, A.R., Scharf K. The calming effect of beach scenes on mood. Journal of Human Psychology, Vol 25. No.4, 2009 Supplementary Materials Some papers will also have a supplemental section. This can contain many things including additional data and tables. In publication you normally have word and space limits and so this section may contain additional information of use to the reader. Bacterial Transformation Mini Lab Writeup How a lab writeup is different than a scientific paper While a lab writeup has a lot in common with a scientific paper, there are many differences. In general, a lab writeup is not presenting new and original research in an area of science. Instead, a lab writeup is a first step toward familiarizing you with the style and flow of scientific writing. A lab writeup helps to demonstrate that you are capturing the essential skills of documenting your work in the lab. Assignment For this lab writeup, we will focus on the methods, results, and discussion of the bacterial transformation lab. Here are the instructions. Team project This writeup will be done as a group project amongst the groups who worked on the lab in class. Sections and length You will be responsible for only three sections described as follows. The length of the assignment should not be more than three pages. You may as a group decide to split the work so that each person is responsible for one (or a part) of a section. Be sure the completed work meets everyone\u2019s approval. Methods : In this section, you should provide a detailed, step-by-step description of the work done in the laboratory. Since you were presented with a method in class you can use this as a starting point, but for each step you must a) note if you modified a step in any way; 2) provide a simple explanation for the purpose of each step. Say what you did, but do not draw conclusions in this section. Results : In this section, you should present image(s) of the final bacterial plates. You should describe what is seen on each plate (e.g., a lawn of growing bacteria, no bacterial growth, bacteria colonies). You may have photos in white and UV light. Describe each photo and what the person viewing should notice. Make it clear which plates have what antibiotics and which plates had bacteria with or without plasmid. Say what you see, but do not draw conclusions in this section. Discussion : In this section, you should present the purpose of the experiment, describing the intention to transform bacteria with the pGFP plasmid. You should explain what the purpose of each plate (with their combinations of plasmid/antibiotics/LB) was. Indicate if the predictions (hypothesis) matched the results you obtained.","title":"Lab writeups"},{"location":"science_topics/writing_labs/#doing-a-lab-writeup","text":"A scientific paper is the key product of research. After perhaps years of work a scientist (actually almost a group of scientists) will write a paper (often called a manuscript) detailing their work.","title":"Doing a lab writeup"},{"location":"science_topics/writing_labs/#purpose-of-the-paper-adding-pieces-to-the-puzzle","text":"The purpose of the paper is to communicate the new contribution the scientists\u2019 work represented. In very rare occasions, that contribution is something new and unexpected (i.e., an entirely new phenomenon). For example, see this article and the original paper on the discovery of that the universe was not static, but expanding. More often, scientists answer smaller questions or pieces of questions. Think about science more as discovering an image as you slowly add puzzle pieces, rather than discovering an image by turning a corner in a museum \u201cand there it is!\u201d What this means is that amongst a group of scientists (usually called a field or discipline, for example \u201ccancer biologists\u201d) there are a variety of related questions big and small. For example, if we asked a school to figure out how cars work (no Wikipedia or Google), we might investigate how engines work, how transmissions work, how gasoline works, how wheels work, etc. There is one big question (how cars work) but the way to answer that is usually by figuring out how individual components work and trying to put that knowledge together. This approach is called reductionism (reducing a large problem to the sum of its parts). It is not the only approach, and does not always work, but that is another conversation. When you write your paper, you are announcing you have found a new and important puzzle piece! But there are problems. Scientific questions usually come from a really big puzzle. Suppose in your section of the puzzle you have found a starfish. Maybe the puzzle is a beach scene? But what if someone else\u2019s puzzle pieces are shaping into a snowy mountain? They might not believe you are interpreting things correctly. You may think the same - maybe their section will turn out to be a cloud? You will not only need to put some context to your work (i.e., we have other pieces that look like sand and water), but you will need to prove you are qualified to tell what starfishes look like (i.e., you have a marine biology degree). You will need to show you are both working on the same puzzle and your pieces belong to the same image.

This hypothesis is also supported by the findings of Nash (1998, 2002) that assembled a beach ball in grid A2 of the puzzle. Lubbock 2017 contested the beach scene hypothesis when they claimed a section of grid A7 suggested a basketball, an item rarely if ever found in beach scenes. We have previously reported several seashell images in grid A6 (Greenwald 2018). Using new method for Computer-Automated-discovery of Marine Life (CAML), a software described in Black 2019 we now report a potential starfish (Asteroidea) in grid A7.
